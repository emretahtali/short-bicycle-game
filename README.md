this is a short little bicycle game i made just for fun, it is a little hard but ends pretty quick because i lost interest in the levelbuilding phase.

it's made in GameMaker Studio 2.

how to play:

get all the coins in the room to open the portal.

enter the portal to get to the next level.

the bicycle has no speed limit, it gets faster and faster as you cycle as long as you don't stop.

all the levels are possible, if you can't pass them change your perspective as this game also has a small amount of a puzzle side.
